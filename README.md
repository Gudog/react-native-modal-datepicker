# react-native-modal-datepicker
A modal based datepicker for React Native with support for single dates, multiple dates and date ranges (start date â€“ end date).

The UI is heavily inspired by Airbnb's mobile app datepicker and the code is inspired by their react-dates library (which is web only).

## Features
* Supports single dates, multiple dates (including non consecutive days) and date ranges.
* Uses the official `<Modal>` component from React Native.
* Uses `<ListView>` to achieve great performance.

## TODO:
* Tests ðŸ˜±
* Document each component and its properties.
